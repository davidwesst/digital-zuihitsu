-   Despite numerous counterattacks, **the goblin numbers never seemed to shrink**.
    
-   The drow fighting force dwindled to only **four survivors**.
    
-   **Mergrim** left to seek help, but by the time he returned, most supporters had abandoned the effort.

### **Plans and Preparations**

-   After studying a map, the group decides to **approach the goblins diplomatically**, posing as **envoys of the Bowmore Nation** looking for a peaceful rest.
    
-   The plan: **rest overnight** and **depart at dawn**.

## **Day 8 – Into the Mines**

-   **Mergrim** leads the way along **worn roads** to the **old invasion base camp**.
    
    -   He plans to **wait 12 hours**, check in, then return after six more hours and continue to monitor the situation.
        
    
-   The party speculates whether the goblins might have **emerged from the Underdark (Khyber)** — possibly through **pocket dimensions**.
  

### **Party Banter**

-   **Balgus** loudly declares his intent to _“penetrate the goblins”_. No further clarification requested.
    
-   **Bowmore** considers **charming Mergrim** to gain his loyalty but decides against it to maintain the ruse.
    
-   **Lori** offers some homemade treats — **Zaps** eats his in a single bite.
    

***

## **Exploring the Mine**

-   The group crosses a **lava-filled cavern**, where they encounter creatures from **Fernia**, the Plane of Fire.
    
-   The beings resemble **upright salamanders** equipped with tools and weapons.
    
-   **Lori** approaches peacefully, but they perceive her as **food** and say so in Common.
    
-   One grabs her, but she **escapes the grapple** successfully.
    

***

### **🗺️ Notes & Theories**

-   The **Fernian creatures** suggest an elemental rift may exist nearby.
    
-   Possible connection between **Fernia** and **Khyber** incursions.
    
-   Goblins may not be the only threat beneath Rackamar.

# Original Notes

- Day 6, on our way to Rackamar. Where Mergrim wants us to defeat the goblins
- Day 7, we arrive late at night and are greeted by two Drough, friends of Mergrim. They spoke Elvish, and Lori tried to subtlety listen in... But didn't succeed
- Rackamar back story 
- Drough were invaded and chased out by goblins 40 years. Everyone wanted it back, but nobody acted in the leadership. They have tried to take it back, but no matter how many they kill the forces never seem to diminish
- Many of the fighting Drough died, down to four people. Mergrim left to get help, but took a while and others supporters left
- After reviewing a map of the place, and deciding to try and talk to the goblins as Bowmore Nation looking to take a break, the party planned to rest for the night and hit them early in the AM
- DAY 8, Mergrim leads the way to through worn out roads to the entrance and to the old invasion base camp. He's going to wait for 12 hours, check back in with the others and return after another six, then wait for a while longer
- Kyhber, the Ebberon underdark, has pocket dimensions, wonder if Goblins might have invaded from the inside
- Balgus wants to penetrate Goblins... Whatever that means.
- Bowmore contemplates charming Mergrim to make him join us, but decided against it so could stick with the ruse
- Lori gave us some treats that Zaps ate in a single bite
- As we explored the mine, we cross the lava and find folks native to the plane of Fernia (fire) that look like they are salamanders that stand upright and have some equipment on
- Lori tried to come in peace, but they saw she as a tasty creature and stated it in common so she knew. She was grabbed but managed to get out of the grapple.
