# Cleaned Up Notes
### August 25, 2025 — Into Firefinger

-   After a long rest, the gnomes presented treasure as payment.
    
-   **Loot & Upgrades:**
    
    -   Zaps: upgraded trench coat and greataxe.
        
    -   Lori: flying mop and circlet of intelligence.
        
    -   Balgus: magic ring.
        
    -   Bowmore: improved armor.
        
-   Lori contacted Corvus to report success—he replied they were well.
    
-   Mergrim stayed behind with the gnomes while the Th’Kkn guided the party.
    
-   By dusk, the group reached Firefinger, home base of the Pterafolk.
    
-   The party brought back a corpse but gained no insights.
    
-   Zaps climbed first, tossing down a rope. Knot tying proved difficult, but everyone made it up.
    
-   Cave exploration:
    
    -   Crossed a gap, spiders appeared but were quickly dispatched.
        
    -   Found a chimney; Balgus climbed and used dwarven tremor sense to detect spiders.
        
    -   Zaps hauled the others up. A Carrion Crawler attacked—Balgus tried speaking with it, but it was uninterested in diplomacy.
        
    -   Bowmore blasted it with _Thunderwave_.
        
    -   Lori fumbled untying the knot but managed to haul Zaps up.
        
    -   Swarms of Stirges attacked, latching onto party members.
        
    -   Zaps raged, wielding Morthas to cleave them apart.
        
-   At the next level, Balgus sensed large creatures approaching—the Pterafolk—leaving the group between them and a deadly 200 ft drop.


# Original Notes
- Long Rested

    - Zaps gets an upgraded trench coat and greataxe
    - Lori gets a flying mop and a circlet to be more intelligent
    - Balgus got ring and
    - Bowmore got better armour
- LORII called back home to let Corvus know wetere good and he replied he was weel
- Mergrim is staying behind with the Gnomes while the Th'Kkn are guiding us.
- After attuning to the items the party sets off and arrives at Firefobger, the home base of the Oterafolk Ina day, just before dusk
- We brow back a corpse and didn't get any insights
- We climbed up, Zaps went first and succeeded at climbing and tossing down a rope. He couldn't tie a knit, but he managed to help everyone get up. Now this rope is tied around him
- We enter a cave and find that it appears to be empty. After jumping across a hole, spiders appeared but we made quick work of them
- We continue exploring and find a chimney which Balgus climbs and uses his dwarven tremor sense where he feels the presence of something like spiders and smaller ones
- Zaps helps lift everyone else up, bringing the team up where Balgus met a Carrion Crawler. He tried to explain by talking to beasts that we weren't food. It did no t believe him
- Bowmore started by casting Thunder wave, while Lori finished climbing and fumbled on untying the knot, so she helped pull up Zaps where we finally managed to untie the rope from her
- Then a swarm of Stirges joined the fight with the Crawler. They attached themselves to many of the party. 
- Zaps, in a rage, used his greataxe Morthas to detach them and murder many 
- As we arrive at the next level, the group climbs up only for Balgus to feel some large creatures heading towards us where we are the only thing between the Pterafolk and a 200 ft drop
