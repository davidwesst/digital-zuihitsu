Hi- A Warforged appeared named MODMOS appeared in the cave as we started to re explore thing.
- He has a song of Bowmore stuck in his head that seems to allow him to follow Bowmore specifically. This was given to him so he could follow us as Janesca from the Trust. Once the gig was done, the skill did not go away and he has been following us since.
- He has a Dragonmark, that matched ours as well.
- After exploring the smoke and using MODMOS ability to see in smoke and otherwise blind areas.
- We moved onto another area where we found an ancient dracany outpost that is strange considering they were never this far out, BUT the outpost is thousands of years old
- We come up to some light and we send MODMOS forward who is still crawling across the ceiling
- We enter the chamber to find 8 orbs, tow pedistals with equipment on them and a big door at the other end of the chamber
- Lori saw the equipment was a control panel and hit some buttons which caused the door to close behind us and two orbs to lit up and shone light on the item in the middle which resulted in a loud sound that actually hurt us and then the lights went out
