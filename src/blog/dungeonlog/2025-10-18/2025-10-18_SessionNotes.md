## **Battle and Interrogation**

-   **Zaps** goes down **a second time** during combat but gets back up each time with help from the party (specifically Bowmore this time) — and immediately returns to **murder more enemies**.
    
-   The group **interrogates the last surviving fire newt**, learning only vague details about a **temple room** before executing it.
    
    -   The creature is **pinned down by a horse hoof** and then finished off in a **cloud of daggers**.
        
    
-   Afterward, the party explores the **area behind the anthamamine forge**, finding sleeping quarters and comparing the layout to the **drow map**.

## **Further Exploration**

-   After a **short rest**, the group ventures deeper and encounters **two warlocks** and **two warrior fire newts****worshipping an unknown statue**.
    
-   **Zaps** unleashes **lightning breath**, then follows with a **critical cleave**, killing both warriors — marking his **fourth natural 20** of the campaign.
    
-   The warlocks retaliate with **six rays of fire**, but only **one hits Zaps**.
    
-   The party captures **one warlock alive** for questioning.

## **The Statue**

-   The group discovers a **statue made of iron, copper, gold, and silver**, with a strange **piece of adamantine**embedded in it — material **not of this world**.
    
-   **Lori** moves the statue and removes the **adamantine fragment**, finding a **pure gold nugget** in its place.
    
-   The warlock provides no useful information and is **executed**.
    
-   The party digs out the **gold fragment**, discovering it’s **part of a key**, which they **store in the Bag of Holding**.

## **Return to Mergrim**

-   The group decides to **leave the mine** and **confront Mergrim** about the **lack of goblins**, planning to **trick him** by claiming they found goblins instead of fire newts.
    
-   Mergrim is **relieved and excited**, assuming the party **cleared the mine**.
    
-   **Balgus**, suspicious of elves, **accuses Mergrim** of deceit and lays out the full story.
    
-   It turns out to be a **misunderstanding** — Mergrim had simply believed that **fire newts were “goblins.”**
    
-   With the confusion resolved, the party and Mergrim agree:
    
    -   They’ll **rest for the night**, and if **no fire newts return**, the job will be considered complete.

## **Back into the Depths**

-   Before resting, the group decides to **re-enter the mine** to ensure nothing was missed.
    
-   **Bowmore** sighs, preferring to abandon the quest, but the others insist on keeping their word.
    
-   **Zaps**, ever the soldier, reminds them:
    
    > “A soldier’s word is truth.”
    
-   The party descends once more with **Mergrim**, mapping the remaining **four unexplored corridors** — hoping this time to find **nothing waiting in the dark**.

---
- Zaps went down twice, but managed to get back up with the help of the party and murder more
- We interrogated the last firenewt, and learned a bit about a temple room but not much. We put it face first into the cloud of daggers while it was pinned down with a horse hoof. He knew nothing about 
- After searching through the remainder of the space behind the anthamamine forge, we found where they slept and started completing the map as compared to the drought.
- After a short rest, we explored further to find two more Warlocks and Warrior fire newts worshipping a statue that we do not recognize
- Zaps used lightening breath and cleaved through the two warriors with the second attack. This is the 4th 20 Zaps has rolled.
- The warlocks responded with 6 rays of fire and only hit Zaps once
- We keep one warlock alive.
- Found a statue made from iron, copper gold and silver with an odd piece antmantium but not looks like it is from this world. Lori moved the statue and removed the piece of antemantium, and finds a piece of gold in its original form.
- We get nothing from the warlock and kill him
- We dig out the gold fragment to find it is part of a key and add it to the bag of holding
- We decided to leave and confront Mergrim about the lack of goblins in the mines— but decided to trick him and tell him that there were goblins instead of fire newts.
- He was happy to hear this and was eager to get back into the cave, assuming we cleared it out— which were weren’t totally sure of as there were some other paths to deal with.
- Confused, Balgus laid it all out and shared the full story, assuming Mergrim was guilty (as Balgus hates elves)
- Turns out Mergim thought fire newts were called “goblins” and it was all just a misunderstanding.
- So, with that we cleared the air and told him the truth and made a deal: we’ll spend the night and assuming no fire newts come back, we’ll call it even.
- Before we rested we decided to go back in and explore, just in case there was something we missed. Bowmore sighed as he wanted to abandon the quest— but the rest of the party didn’t want to leave a deal undone.
- Zaps knows, a soldier’s word is truth.
- And so the party went back in, with Mergrim, and started to finish mapping the cave hoping they find nothing else. With four more corridors, there clearly more to do.
