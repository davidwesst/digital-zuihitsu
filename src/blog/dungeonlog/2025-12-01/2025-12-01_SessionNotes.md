The Battle and puzzle to get out of the room continues! 
- Lori started solving the puzzles
- Zaps and Bowmore managed to kill the remaining big things with multiple mouths, along with a couple of the dolgrims, and some kind of tenticle vampiric creature that literally sucked the life out of Jeremy, the Fae creature summoned by Balgus
- The door finally opened and the remaining beasts faded out of existence, as did the remains of the dead ones
- After following the fresh air that came from the tunnel beyond the giant door, we found ourselves back where we started at the 6 kings monument at the border of Droaam of Brelande (homeland of Sharon)
- After a smoke with Zaps feet dangling over the edge of the monument the group decided to head back through the pocket dimension and report back to Mergrim and introduce him to our new friend MODMOS
- Mergrim said he'd guard the caves with his team while the party rested. Lori messaged Corvas and Gurack on Day 8 just before we rested for the night for a well deserved rest
- With the party's part of the bargain fulfilled, Mergrim and the ThreeKin rejoined and we shared the details of the prophecy shared by Von Zeclin, the former general chasing us with undead which we assume is working with the overlord.
- MODMOS is happy about learned they have a soul, which everyone visually sighed and moved on
- two days of travel, Lori knitted some Bowmore Nation merch for MODMOS and made cookies
- Near the end of day two, Mergrim suggest we fly above the trees to see a sight. Lori flew up on her mop, and Zaps followed to see a floating island in the shape of a human heart which is only a  few hours away.
- Bats seem to be flying around and the island is 200 feet above ground. Mergrim let us know we would reach it by morning
- The next day, we head towards the base of the heart. One of the ThreeKin stop and and say there is something up ahead
- Zaps charged in to be sprayed by a cloud of poison from a Snake abomination thing and a group of snake creatures. He was poisoned and blinded but still shot back some lightening. They attacked, and literally with one HP left, he survived the ordeal thanks  to the all bean treat  before he ate before the fight.
- Lori healed him up, the poison wore off and Zaps started killing while the group attacked the abomination
- one down four to go.
