## Original Notes

- We climbed up and Balgus sent his familiar hawk in his stead who poops on people if he likes them
- Zaps, trying to go forward, manages to fail to climb further and falls almost to the ground. He manages to deploy his wings before he hit the ground, BUT he awoke a couple of Girallon Zombies that were resting in the trees by being a pachinko ball hitting the branches on the way down
-  Our old friend, the ghoul priest and his six ghouls return to take us on. The party's luck continued to be terrible, but through rage fueled attacks, clouds of daggers, a swarm of angry jungle bugs, they survived even if one guide (Cask of Dreams) was knocked unconscious
-  Back on the ship wreak in the trees, Lori healed everyone to engage the crew of the ship. They were a Gnomes who built a flying machine.  They were coming from an expedition, a week South from here
-  Some of their party were taken by Ptera-Folk (pterodactil-like) which our guides noted those gnomes will be food will be food for their nest
-  Fire Finger is where the Pterafolk are from, which is nearby our current location
-  We receive a proposition from the Gnomish crew, they'll give us rare magic equipment/item or two uncommon each, including the guides
-  The party agrees to it, but Mergrim the drough guide says this is our last delay to our destination. The group takes a short rest, with the plan of spending the night in the safety of the trees

### DnD Mondays: Episode 14 — "The Pachinko Gambit

- The party continued their ascent through the jungle canopy. Balgus, ever cautious (and possibly just lazy), stayed behind and sent his familiar—a hawk with the peculiar habit of pooping on those it likes—in his place.
- Zaps attempted to climb ahead but failed spectacularly. He bounced through the branches like a living pachinko ball, barely managing to deploy his wings before hitting the ground.
  - Unfortunately, the noise woke a pair of **Girallon Zombies** resting in the treetops.
- To make matters worse, the **ghoul priest** from a previous encounter returned—this time with six ghouls.
  - The party’s luck continued to be dismal, but they survived the encounter thanks to:
    - Zaps' rage-fueled attacks
    - Bowmore’s **cloud of daggers**
    - Balgus’ **swarm of angry jungle bugs**
  - One guide, **Cask of Dreams**, was knocked unconscious but stabilized.
- Back at the **shipwreck in the trees**, Lori tended to the wounded before the group encountered a crew of **gnomes**.
  - The gnomes had constructed a **flying machine** and were returning from an expedition roughly a week south of their current position.
  - Several gnomes had been taken by **Ptera-Folk**—pterodactyl-like creatures known for abducting victims to feed their young.
    - According to the guides, the gnomes' captured companions were likely destined to be food for the **Fire Finger** nests, located nearby.
- The gnomes offered the party a deal:
  - Help recover their comrades, and each party member (including guides) would receive either one **rare magical item** or two **uncommon items**.
- The party accepted, but **Mergrim**, their dour drow guide, declared this would be the final detour before reaching their ultimate destination.
- The session ended with the group taking a **short rest**, planning to spend the night suspended in the trees above the danger below.
