-  The battle with the Pterafolk continues
-  When Lori cast bless it was in the form of Bowmore merch we wanted, to which Zaps chose a scarf
-  Eventually went through the whole clan of Pterafolk (10 or so, where zaps did at least 6 but lost count)
-  We got some treasure from slaughtered Ptera, and took a bag of thighs as meat for NaNAPUPU
-  On returning she gobbled one thigh quickly and messy, and said we need to spend the night. Tomorrow we can do an augery to find the lost path to Omu.
-  We decided to keep helping out while we wait for the night by doing chores. Lori and MODMOS mending thing, Zaps hauled water, cleaned himself up and chopped all the wood
-  Balgus was consulting the stars to see if he could gleen anything from what he learned from what Onell shared
-  We lit a fire while MODMOS stayed alert and was alerted by shadowy figures approaching
-  Bowmore sent a message to the shadowed figures only to get animal noise
-  After MODMOF was sent out to sneak, MODMOS learned that they were just flying monkeys
-  Balgus spoken with animals and found that there was no NaniPiPi, they had not heard of Omu
-  Lori fed them muffins
-  We go back to bed for a short rest and wake up to a loud scream of an old lady
-  We run to the tent to find an old lady over the body of a dead flying monkey with a swollen mouth
-  She screamed someone poisoned my monkey!
