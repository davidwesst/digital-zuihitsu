# Cleaned Up Notes
### September 1, 2025 — Blood in the Sky Tower

-   Zaps raged again, cutting down a charging pteranodon in one swing with Morthas.
    
-   More Pterafolk pressed in through the tunnels but were met with rage, spells, and blades.
    
-   After battling 3 Pterafolk and an acolyte, the cave was cleared, though not all the gnome hostages survived.
    
-   Survivors included several weakened gnomes and an Aarakocra monk, captured long before the gnomes, likely for ransom.
    
-   Hostages stabilized and freed. Party discovered a chimney leading to the top.
    
-   Zaps vaulted up and landed among Pterafolk, including their leader.
    
-   Another hostage was being stuffed into a magically fueled oven.
    
-   Battle erupted:
    
    -   Zaps carved through 7–8 Pterafolk, cutting down many.
        
    -   Lori, drained of spells, dove into the oven, burning her tail to rescue the hostage.
        
    -   Some Pterafolk tried dive-bombing Zaps, infecting him with fear—yet he still cut them down.
        
    -   Balgus summoned falling stars, Bowmore unleashed daggers, and together they whittled the flock down.
        
    -   Zaps even hurled a handaxe, killing one mid-flight.
        
-   The last two Pterafolk fled. Firefinger was secured.
    
-   Treasure recovered at the top.
    
-   The party flew down on Lori’s mop with freed hostages, camping at the tower base.
    
-   Next morning:
    
    -   The Aarakocra monk departed.
        
    -   Zaps gave Whispers and Silence a terrifying joyride with draconic flight and a dive-bomb finale.
        
-   The convoy returned—despite Zaps getting everyone lost—thanks to the Th’Kkn’s guidance.
    
-   They arrived back at camp where a rescue airship awaited the original crash survivors.
    
-   The gnomes departed. Mergrim pressed the party, frustrated, asking if they would finally be ready to leave in the morning.
# Original Notes

- Zaps went into another Rage and attacked the charging Ptera, killing them in a single round with Morthas, his Greataxe
- Terrified, more of the Pterafolk came forward through the tunnel trying to push the party to the edge only to be met with more anger, rage, and a cloud of daggers
- 3 Pterafolk, and one Ptera Acolyte later the cave was clear and the party was safe for the moment, although there was evidence that not all the gnomes had made it near the 
- Here they found a number weakened Gnomish folks and one Airacaw (bird person) named _name missing_, a monk from a nearby monastery that was on patrol. He had been there for much longer than the gnomes and believe the Pterafolk were holding him for ransom or something
- After stabilizing and freeing the hostages, the group found a chimney leading to the top from what they could gather.
- With the party ready to go, Zaps threw himself up the chimney and landed in a group of Pterafolk, positioning himself right by the leader.
- They heard another hostage being carried into what looked like an hotbox or oven, being fueled by a magical flame.
- The group got to work with an enraged Zaps starting by cutting down some Pterafolk and cleaving through to others.
- This time there were many, 7 or 8 including the leader and Zaps started chopping them down.
- Lorileth, already out of spells from the climb up, managed to get into the oven and save the stranger the Ptera had put into the oven-- singing her tail, but saving the gnome.
- A group flew off and started to dive bomb Zaps and get their revenge, but Balgus started shooting at this with stars, and Zaps stopped one in their tracks and cut him down, even though they infected him with fear and he couldn't move towards him.
- Between Balgus, the Boremore's daggers, and Morthas being wielded by Zaps the party broke them down one by one.
- Zaps even managed to hit one in the air with a handaxe, taking it down.
- The remaining Ptera (2 of them) fled, and the group took a sigh of relief as Firefinger was clear of foes.
- After a search of the top, the group found a bunch of treasure and money and returned to the based of the tower by flying down with Zaps and Lori's magical flying mop where they camped and long rested for the night with the free hostages.
- The next morning, the Airacaw left and Zaps had fun flying Whispers and Slience up to the top of firefinger with an exclusive draconic flight-- complete with a dive bomb on the way down for his amusement, not so much theirs.
- The convoy returned, despite Zaps taking point and getting the group a little lost-- the Threekin got everyone back on track and the group returned to find a rescue airship coming to help the original crash survivors.
- The gnomes left the group, and a frustrated Mergrim asked if they would be ready to leave in the AM
- They will be ready.
