The Battle continues...and we run away. 
- MODMOS informed the party he has feather fall.
- Lori cast motivation speech and informed the team to flee
- Moments from death, MODMOS cast fog cloud which Zaps took the moment to escape and ran out of the cloud, out of the cave, and off the edge knowing his team has his back.
- MODMOS cast feathfall and Lori and sent her mop after Zaps just to make sure he landed safely
- We eventually make camo and long rest and level up (to level 6)
-   Talking at camp, we learn share the details of the double cross and learn that Omu is
- Zaps wants to end the profecy by getting stronger, finding Omu, and ended the Overlord
- Cask and Dreams, Whispers and Silence our guides shared directions to some possible ways to find the lost city of Omu (which they also informed us about)
- Emballa is where the old lady is, who might know more about Odu and is 4 days away
- 3 days away is the monestary where we our friend, Mephyr, is based out of. 
- Mergrim left to return to his town to rebuild
- After the rest we head off to see if we can find the old lady
- Lori sent a message to gurak, the orc kid, to inform him of the betrayal and Corvus cannot be trusted. Through the messages she managed to find out Guruk is in hiding
- We start our trek and find ourselves climbing a narrow cliffside up a 3 mile switchback path. Lots of tumbled boulders get cleared by us in the process
- We get a great view at the top
- We find stone carved stairs and carvings on the side
- We hit the top and find at the top of path,, the top of the plateau we find an old gate, a bunch of bleached human skulls
- We check for traps and magic, finding nothing. There are only ruins here other than one hut, with animal skin covered hut that is clearly maintained
- We walk up to hut when the door opens to see an impossibly old woman greets us complete with cataracts and hunched from severe artheris
- We introduce ourselves, her name is NaniPupu
- Arrive at Membala in day 16 of our trip
- The lady asks what is in it for her. Lori offered muffins, but she did not like them. Instead Balgus asked if there was "something she needed" which had innuendo in it, although not intended.
- she asked us to take care of some Terra Folk causing her grief in exchange for info on how to get to Omu.
- Its an hour away, in a cliffface that requires some flights
- We agree and head out
- MODMOF, is MODMOS's tiny spider familiar designed mostly for friendship
- Balgus cast Thorn Armour on Zaps as he run into the Frey surprising a Pterafolk
